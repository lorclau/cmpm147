				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The motivation behind this project is simple — I wanted to see what kind of comments I could create! It started as a fun experiment to generate random, interesting, or even funny comments that could be used on social media platforms. I think small, positive interactions can brighten someone’s day, so I wanted to create a generator that would help users come up with comments that feel friendly and supportive.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For this project, I remixed a template on Glitch. I made a new constant fillers object and used a new template string so that the generator could create a prompt structured like a social media comment. I also changed the text in the button by editing the html.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Editing the code in this template was fairly straightforward and easy to understand. It gave me a good introduction into generation and how it works. I only experienced difficulties when using Glitch to edit the code, but I was able to work around it.</p>
