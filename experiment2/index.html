				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:

  				<img src="foggy_mountains.jpg" alt="Photograph of foggy mountains by Daniel Seßler" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

					<a href="https://unsplash.com/@danielsessler" target="_blank">Daniel Seßler</a>
				</p>
				<p><br>Relation to inspring image:<br><br>

					- Color: The sky, mountains, and cloud colors were sampled from the inspiring image.<br>
					- Primitives: The clouds are rendered with `ellipse` primitives.<br>
					- Polygons: All mountains are randomly generated polygons made using `vertex` calls with different constraints.<br>
					- Composition: Different random values lead to differently shaped mountains and differently positioned clouds each time the page is loaded.<br>
					- Life: The clouds are animated overtime to simulate the natural slow drift of fog in the mountains. Much like in real life, the fog moves across the upper part of the mountain peaks.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I layered multiple mountain shaped polygons (generated with vertex shapes and procedural noise) to create atmospheric depth. Each mountain layer is assigned different noise scales, vertical offsets, and HSB color attributes (hue, saturation, brightness, alpha). The clouds are drawn separately on an off-screen createGraphics buffer using thresholded noise values for a natural, evolving cloud shape. The clouds drift across the canvas overtime by incrementing cloudOffsetX and cloudOffsetY inside the draw() function. Vertical color interpolation (lerpColor) is used to draw a smooth gradient sky.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>There were many amazing inspirational images to choose from, but ultimately I was attracted to this image for its calming aesthetic. In the spirit of abstraction and preserving the soothing mood of the image, I tried to preserve the overall compostition of the image and the colors, but added some life with the slow moving clouds. 
					My biggest challenges with this project were adding the appropritate contraints to the generated shapes and creating the clouds, but these are the aspects that sell the piece so it was worth the struggle.
					I was able to overcome these challenges by consulting public forums and reference guides to learn about potential solutions, then I applied them to my code and adjusted until I was happy with the outcome.
