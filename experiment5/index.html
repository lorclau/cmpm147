				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">

				  <p style="text-align: center;">This generator directly reads inspiring images (black and white silhouettes of fruit), renders parameterized images, and adjusts its designs to optimize an evaluation score.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>This project integrates inspiring images that are selectable from the drop-down on the display page. (This could be three distinct images or one image with three different sets of clues that cause the generator to interpret it in a different way.)</li>
                    <li>The design object is initialized in inspiration-specific ways. Selecting different inspirations should lead to different behaviors of initDesign.</li>
                    <li>The design is rendered in a way that can possibly produce results that feel related to the inspiring images. (The 30-second annealing trick should produce images that resemble the inspiring image if we squint.)</li>
                    <li>The mutation process makes incremental changes to your design. The rate parameter should be implemented in a way that allows the user to almost stop exploration by sliding the rate down to 1%. Your generator must respond to the mutation rate slider.</li>
                </ol>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I set out to make an enjoyable visual evolution whose results would be easily identifiable, and I think I was able to achieve that.
					I am happy with the results of this project and how much detail the generator is able to capture.
                    The most challenging part was making constant adjustments to ensure that each image was generated well overtime.
                    I had to make sure I didnâ€™t get caught up in the details by spending too much time making small adjustments.
                    To prevent this, I would ask a friend to identify the image, once they identified it correctly I knew it was a good time to stop.
